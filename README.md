# DAA_Project

Implementd an algorithm that finds the best allocations for all professors and courses, i.e. the
algorithm should find the best professors for courses based on the course content and the
expertise of the professor. Please note that the number of professors and courses is the same.
Hence, every professor must teach a course and every course must be taught by a professor.
Obviously it would be ideal that every course is taught by a professor who masters its topics.
However, this may not always be possible. Hence, we are interested in maximizing the totality of
our course matching (meaning we want to find the best overall allocations of courses and
teachers).
